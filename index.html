    <h4>Whts is CSS?</h4>
    <ol class="class1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="class2"><span class="line1"> is not neccessary</span><span class="highlight">CSS saves a lot of work.</span></span> It can control the layout of multiple web page all at once.</li><br>
        <li class="line">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>

    <p class="class3">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="spacing">
        <li>Inline - by using the cycle attribute inside HTML element</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS file. However,<span class="highlight"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this 
            is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>
  <span class="class4">
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other html, applies a style to one uniwue element. ID is also
    special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an elemet and it's use by JavaScript.</p>

    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied
        to the element.</p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selection available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should
            be applied.</p>
